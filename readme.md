Currently a WIP.

This repository is an exercise in sampling and classification techniques on the Credit Card Fraud dataset from <a href = https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data>Kaggle</a>. The repository uses `caret` and `keras` (over Tensorflow) in R for classification.


The markdown output can be viewed <a href = https://github.com/pan-alex/Credit_Fraud-kaggle/blob/master/Outputs/2018-05-02_Kaggle_Credit_Fraud.md>here</a>.


The best way to view the output is to clone/download the repository and open **Outputs/2018-05-02_Kaggle_Credit_Fraud.html**
